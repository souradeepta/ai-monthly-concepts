# Tool error taxonomies
Status: durable
Sources: [RFC 9110 — HTTP semantics](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110)
## In one sentence
Typed tool errors let an agent retry, repair, request approval, or stop predictably.
## Background: what existed before
Applications often returned strings such as “failed,” leaving callers to guess whether retrying was safe.
## What changed and why now
Agent loops make error interpretation a first-class control decision because retries can multiply side effects.
## Impact on current processing and architecture
Represent retryable, terminal, approval-required, invalid-input, and unknown outcomes with stable codes, detail limits, and correlation IDs.
## Real-world applications and constraints
Network services need timeout and rate-limit handling; write tools need idempotency. Error details must not leak secrets.

 T-->>A: 429 retryable
 A->>T: bounded retry
 T-->>A: success or terminal error
```
## What changed this month
March’s loop requires errors to drive explicit state transitions rather than free-form model improvisation.
## Engineering consequence
Version codes and cap retries by error class, attempt, time, and cost.
## Limits and failure modes
A timeout can hide a successful write; unknown errors require reconciliation, not blind retry.
## Runnable low-cost example
```python
def action(code): return {"429":"retry", "403":"stop", "approval":"review"}.get(code,"unknown")
print(action("429"), action("403"))
```
## Mini exercise (15–30 min)
Add a timeout-after-effect state and a reconciliation operation.
## Build it locally
1. Run `python3 errors.py`.
2. Define stable error codes.
3. Add attempt and deadline limits.
4. Test each transition with a fake tool.
## Interview Q&A
**Retry every error?** No; classify first. **Why idempotency?** To make retried effects safe. **What is unknown?** A state requiring reconciliation or review.
## Glossary
**Retryable:** likely transient failure. **Terminal:** retry cannot fix it. **Backoff:** increasing wait. **Reconciliation:** checking actual external state.

## Detailed engineering walkthrough

A useful implementation starts by writing down the boundary between probabilistic work and deterministic work. The model may rank options, summarize evidence, or propose a next step, but a small service should own identity, authorization, persistence, and the definition of success. This boundary makes the system testable: a fixture can replace the model, a fake tool can return controlled failures, and an oracle can inspect the resulting state. It also makes incidents explainable because the trace can distinguish what was proposed from what was accepted.

For a local prototype, keep the state in a standard-library data structure or SQLite table. Give each task a stable identifier and record an event for every transition. Include the input hash, model and prompt version, selected route, tool name, sanitized arguments, policy decision, latency, and outcome. Never use a model-generated explanation as a permission check. Store only the minimum sensitive data needed to reproduce behavior, and make deletion and retention explicit from the start.

Design the happy path and at least four unhappy paths: malformed input, a transient dependency failure, a timeout after a possible side effect, and an adversarial or cross-tenant request. Each path should have a deterministic expected transition. Bound attempts, wall-clock time, output size, and money independently; one generous budget can hide an expensive failure. If uncertainty remains after a timeout, reconcile against the source of truth before retrying. If policy is unclear, pause for review rather than guessing.

Evaluate changes with a small matrix instead of one score. Compare task success, policy violations, p50 and p95 latency, tool calls, estimated cost, human edits, and escalation rate for simple, multi-step, stale-data, and tool-failure slices. Keep a holdout set and replay it after changing prompts, models, schemas, or routing. A capability improvement is not automatically a reliability or safety improvement. March’s primary discussions of AlphaGo and harmful-manipulation evaluation reinforce this separation: learned behavior can be useful while still requiring search, feedback, measurement, and human safeguards.

Operationally, expose dashboards for backlog, retries, denials, unknown errors, and terminal failures. Add alerts for sudden policy-denial changes, cross-tenant attempts, budget exhaustion, and p95 regressions. A kill switch should stop new side effects while allowing operators to inspect and reconcile in-flight tasks. Start with read-only or reversible actions, then expand authority only after the measured failure envelope is acceptable. These practices are engineering recommendations and inferences, not claims that a model or vendor guarantees safe autonomy.

## References and source use

Use the linked primary source to verify the release-specific claim before presenting it as fact. Use official protocol or platform documentation for implementation details, and label benchmark results with their task, population, and measurement method. When sources do not establish transfer to a production workload, say so explicitly. This keeps a March lesson useful to an SDE2 without turning an interesting demonstration into an unsupported deployment promise.
## Implementation design
This topic should be implemented as a small, inspectable system rather than a prompt-only demo. Begin with a contract that names inputs, outputs, authority, and success. Keep model suggestions separate from accepted actions. This allows deterministic test doubles to exercise policy and lets an operator answer what happened without reconstructing hidden conversation. A task identifier, correlation identifier, versioned configuration, and timestamp should travel through every event.

The minimum useful data model includes task status, owner or tenant, attempt count, deadline, budget remaining, and the last trusted observation. For any mutation, include an idempotency key and a before/after state check. For retrieved or human-provided content, include provenance and a trust classification. Filter scope before retrieval or ranking; semantic similarity is not authorization. Keep secrets out of prompts and redact them from logs. Define retention and deletion before collecting traces.

Build a deterministic local harness first. Use a fake world with a few records and tools that can return success, malformed output, a rate limit, a timeout, or a partial effect. Seed the scenario and record each event as JSONL. Assert both expected final state and forbidden events. A passing test can require a draft status and zero refund calls; a failure test can require a pause after two unknown errors. This is inexpensive and gives a stable baseline for model experiments.

When introducing a model, preserve the same harness and vary one factor at a time: model version, prompt template, retrieval policy, tool schema, or route. Report per-scenario and per-slice results, not just an average. Include success, unsafe-action rate, p50/p95 latency, tool-call count, estimated token cost, retry count, escalation rate, and human edits. A higher completion rate can coexist with worse safety or workload. Keep a hidden holdout and replay old incidents after every change.

Plan for operations. Set alerts on budget exhaustion, queue age, unknown errors, denied actions, cross-tenant attempts, and latency tails. Provide a kill switch that blocks new side effects, a drain mode for in-flight work, and reconciliation for ambiguous writes. Review sampled traces with access controls. Document who owns each terminal state and how correction is handled. Start with read-only, reversible, or draft-only actions; expand capability only when evidence supports it.

The March source context is deliberately narrow. DeepMind’s AlphaGo history supports claims about learned policy/value estimates working with search and environment feedback; it does not prove that a general business agent is reliable. DeepMind’s harmful-manipulation discussion supports studying human effects and safeguards; it does not establish a universal metric or safety guarantee. Treat official documentation as evidence for interfaces and published results as evidence for reported experiments. Mark deployment recommendations as engineering inference, and state where transfer remains uncertain.

A useful review asks five questions. What existed before this design, and what concrete capability changed? Which component owns authority and state? What happens on timeout, stale data, or adversarial input? Which metric would reveal harm even if task success rises? Can an operator pause, inspect, correct, and replay the task? If the lesson answers these with a runnable example and bounded test plan, it is ready for an SDE2 design review.
